## Description

Water on Grounds is a Django-based web application designed to crowdsource the mapping and approval of water stations within buildings.

The app allows users to submit information about water stations, including their location and type. Admin users have the ability to review and approve submitted water stations, ensuring accuracy and appropriateness. 

The application also features a mapping component, providing a visual representation of approved water stations within buildings. Users can explore this interactive map to locate water stations on different floors and areas of a building.

The project aims to promote sustainability by encouraging the use of reusable water bottles and making water stations easily accessible and visible within indoor spaces.
